PROGRAM
=======

PhageTerm.py - run as command line in a shell


UPDATES
=======
MOP Update: 
added env.yml files for python install. Changes to make python3-compatible. Tested on MacOSX py3.

Bug fix:
When the repeat region (of DTR phages) wraps around the reference contig ends, the first and last bases of the repeat region were missing in the reported sequence.
Bug fixed thanks to Matthew Lueder (Naval Medical Research Center-Frederick).

Bug fix: cohesive sequence of COS 3' phages are now correctly determined. 
Thanks to Dr Wei Shen.

VERSION
=======

Version 1.0.12.1


INTRODUCTION
============

PhageTerm software is a tool to determine phage termini and packaging mode
from high throughput sequences that rely on the random fragmentation of DNA (e.g. 
Illumina TruSeq). Phage sequencing reads from a fastq file are aligned to the phage 
reference genome in order to calculate two types of coverage values (whole genome coverage 
and the starting position coverage). The starting position coverage is used to perform a 
detailed termini analysis. If the user provides the host sequence, reads that does not 
match the phage genome are tested on the host using the same mapping function.

The PhageTerm program and information is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/phageterm/

A Galaxy wrapper version is also available at https://galaxy.pasteur.fr

INSTALL
============
Currently only [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installation is supported. 

```
# python2
# won't work with the python3 upgrades, but will work with authors' original 1.0.12 code.
$ conda env create -f env.yml
# python3
$ conda env create -f env3.yml
```
